MultiEditing for Visual Studio 2012/2013/2015
===================================
Simultaneously edit in more than one location in the editor

If you've ever ran into a case where you wanted to quickly change variable names or multiple loop conditions - you can use Multi-Edit to set virtual carets that all behave the same.

You can check an [installable extension on the gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/2beb9705-b568-45d1-8550-751e181e3aef) for Visual Studio 2012/2013/2015.

How to use
===========
ALT Click on different locations in your code to set multiple carets, and then type as you normally would.

Thanks to [Xavier Poinas](https://github.com/xps) for adding support to all languages other than C# (and teaching me something new)
